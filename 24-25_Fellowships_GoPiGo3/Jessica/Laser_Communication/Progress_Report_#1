Issues Encountered

Initial technical difficulties with installing Raspberry Pi OS and connecting via SSH. These were resolved with troubleshooting efforts and advisor support.
Camera functionality is limited; working on improving streaming and recording capabilities.


Next Steps

Continue refining camera functionality and integrating it with ThingSpeak.
Complete GoPiGo tutorials and further develop the control and data processing features.
Begin researching laser communication and laser terrain mapping ahead of schedule.
Start testing PiOneer’s sensors and logging real-time data on ThingSpeak.
Work on autonomous navigation to align with the October milestone for remote and autonomous control.



Overall Assessment

I am on track and meeting most of the early milestones and laying solid groundwork for future goals.
I've been proactive in identifying and resolving technical issues and integrating components like sensors and remote control.

I plan to allocate more time to autonomous navigation this month and continue building on my progress with sensors to meet the November goals.
