- These projects are supported by the [NASA Nebraska Space Grant](https://www.nespacegrant.org)
- This is the repository for Western Nebraska Community College NASA Nebraska Space Grant Student Fellowships and NASA projects.
- Enhancing Computer Science Curriculum using off-the-shelf Robotics Kits to Increase Whole Brain Learning. This is part of an ongoing project by Bill Loring (Mentor). Thor and Tyr the Mars Stair Climbing Rover are part of this project.

# Current Projects

## Sp25 Tyr the Mars Rover

In Norse mythology, the Scandinavian god most closely associated with Mars, the Roman god of war, is Týr (pronounced "teer").

Týr is primarily depicted as a god of justice, courage, and war, which aligns with Mars's characteristics, and the name "Tuesday" in English is derived from "Týr's day." Considered a brave and just warrior, often associated with upholding oaths and agreements.

### Famous Myth

In Norse stories, Týr famously lost his hand while trying to bind the monstrous wolf Fenrir.

### Connection to Mars

The "interpretatio romana" (Roman interpretation) of Norse gods often linked Týr with Mars.

Take a look at the project in the [Tyr](/Tyr) folder.
