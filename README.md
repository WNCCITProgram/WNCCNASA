## Sp25 Tyr the Mars Rover

In Norse mythology, the Scandinavian god most closely associated with Mars, the Roman god of war, is Týr (pronounced "teer").

Týr is primarily depicted as a god of justice, courage, and war, which aligns with Mars's characteristics, and the name "Tuesday" in English is derived from "Týr's day". Considered a brave and just warrior, often associated with upholding oaths and agreements.
Famous myth:

In Norse stories, Týr famously lost his hand while trying to bind the monstrous wolf Fenrir.

Connection to Mars: The "interpretatio romana" (Roman interpretation) of Norse gods often linked Týr with Mars.

Take a look at the project in the [Mars_Rover](/Mars_Rover/) folder.
