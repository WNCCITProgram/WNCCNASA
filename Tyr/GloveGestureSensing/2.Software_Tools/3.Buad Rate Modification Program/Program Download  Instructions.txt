If the glove cannot connect to Bluetooth, or the device cannot be manipulated after successful connection, please download this program to the somatosensory glove, and then check the printed content in the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE.
If the output still shows garbled text, you will need to re-download the program.
If the output is normal, then navigate to the path "2. Software Tools & Source Code\2. Program Source Code\lehand" and download the "lehand.ino" program to the motion-sensing glove to control the device properly.
